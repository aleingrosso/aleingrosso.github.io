# CDS: Machine Learning (NWI-NM048D)

  * Master course - 3 EC
  * Teaching Assistants: [Eduardo Dominguez](mailto:eduardo.dominguezvazquez@donders.ru.nl), [Mauricio Diaz-Ortiz](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/diaz-ortiz-jr-m)

This [course](https://ru.osiris-student.nl/onderwijscatalogus/extern/cursus?taal=en&cursuscode=NWI-NM048D&collegejaar=2025) is intended for Master's students in physics and mathematics as well as master's students in artificial intelligence/computer science with sufficient mathematical background.

## Main topics

* Probabilistic approach to machine learning (Bayesian inference, evidence framework for model comparison)
* Learning and generalization in classification problems (perceptrons)
* Gradient descent methods in machine learning and neural networks
* Deep neural networks
* Inference and learning in graphical models

## Course Material
Each lecture comes with an interactive jupyter notebook. Find the notebooks at this [repo](https://github.com/aleingrosso/cds_ml).

## Books
  * [Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms](https://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf) by David MacKay.
  * [Machine Learning: a probabilistic perspective](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book0.html) by Kevin Murphy.
