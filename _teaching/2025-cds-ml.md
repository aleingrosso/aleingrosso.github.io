# CDS: Machine Learning (NWI-NM048D)

  * Master course - 3 EC
  * Teaching Assistants: [Eduardo Dominguez](mailto:edv2rd0@gmail.com), [Aaron Villanueva](mailto:aaronv@science.ru.nl)

This [course](https://ru.osiris-student.nl/onderwijscatalogus/extern/cursus?taal=en&cursuscode=NWI-NM048D&collegejaar=2025) is intended for Master's students in physics and mathematics as well as master's students in artificial intelligence/computer science with sufficient mathematical background.

## Exam

The students will work in groups of maximum 3 persons. The grade will be the weighted average of homework assignments. There will be no final examination.

## Main topics

* Probabilistic approach to machine learning (Bayesian inference, evidence framework for model comparison).
* Learning and generalization in classification problems (perceptrons).
* Gradient descent methods in machine learning and neural networks.
* Deep neural networks.
* Inference and learning in graphical models.

## Course Material
Each lecture comes with an interactive jupyter notebook containing. The material will also be available in pdf format.

## Books
  * [Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms](https://www.google.com/search?q=book.pdf) by David MacKay.
  * Machine Learning: a probabilistic perspective by Kevin Murphy.
