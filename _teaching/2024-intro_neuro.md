# Introduction to computational neuroscience
I gave this 20 hours course from 2020 to 2024 in the [Postgraduate Diploma Programme](https://diploma.ictp.it/courses/qls.aspx) in [Quantitative Life Sciences](https://www.ictp.it/qls) at [ICTP](https://www.ictp.it/) as an independent senior postdoc.

I also gave this course in the 2024-25 academic year as a visiting professor. The course was supplemented by a section on Evolution on Neural Systems by [Alessandro Treves](https://phdcns.sissa.it/faculty/alessandro-treves) from [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/).

## Main topics

* Neural dynamics
  - Biophysics of neural excitability (Hodgkin-Huxley model)
  - Stochastic models of spike generation
  - Generalized IF models
  - Mean-field analysis of population dynamics
* Neural coding
  - Analysis of spike trains
  - Neural encoding models and GLMs
* Methods in computational neuroscience
  - Linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction
  - Boltzman machines
* Neural computation
  - Learning algorithms for recurrent neural networks (Reservoir computing, FORCE, BPTT)
