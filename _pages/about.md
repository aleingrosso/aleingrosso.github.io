I'm Assistant Professor in the [Neurophysics](https://www.ru.nl/en/education/masters/neurophysics) section at the [Donders Centre for Neuroscience](https://www.ru.nl/en/donders-centre-for-neuroscience), [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/en).

I'm interested in understanding learning in artificial and biological systems. To this aim, I adopt a research approach at the intersection of **Statistical Physics**, **Machine Learning** and **Theoretical Neuroscience**.

Research Interests
======
* Statistical mechanics of deep learning
* Dynamics and learning in recurrent neural networks
* Efficiency of neural computation
* Multiscale methods for neural networks

Bio
======

I studied Cognitive Psychology (2004-2007) and Physics (2007-2013), obtaining a PhD in Physics at [PoliTo](https://www.polito.it/en) in 2016.

I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/), Columbia University (2016-2020) and an independent senior postdoc at [ICTP](https://www.ictp.it/), Trieste (2020-2024).

Since September 2024, I am Assistant Professor at Radboud University, Nijmegen.
