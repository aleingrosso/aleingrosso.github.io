I'm an Assistant professor in the [Neurophysics](https://www.ru.nl/en/education/masters/neurophysics) section at the [Donders Centre for Neuroscience](https://www.ru.nl/en/donders-centre-for-neuroscience), [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/en).

I'm interested in understanding learning in artificial and biological systems. To this aim, I adopt a research approach at the intersection between Statistical Physics, Machine Learning and Theoretical Neuroscience.

Research Interests
======
* Statistical mechanics of learning in neural networks
  - learning capacity and generalization in deep networks
  - theory of transfer and multi-task learning

* Dynamics and learning in recurrent neural networks
  - dynamical mean field theory for heterogeneous networks
  - learning in biologically-plausible RNNs

* Efficiency of neural computation
  - stochastic thermodynamics of learning at the mesoscale
  - computation-dissipation tradeoffs in neural systems

* Multiscale methods for neural networks
  - advanced Monte Carlo methods and the loss landscape of learning problems
  - coarse graining for neural representations

Bio
======

I studied Cognitive Psychology (2004-2007) and Physics (2007-2013), obtaining a PhD in Physics at [PoliTo](https://www.polito.it/en) in 2016.

I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/), Columbia University (2016-2020) and an independent senior postdoc at [ICTP](https://www.ictp.it/), Trieste (2020-2024).

Since September 2024, I am an assistant professor at Radboud University, Nijmegen.
