Neural systems are intricate networks that perform functions. Our aim is to understand how computation emerges from their complex dynamics. We do this employing two parallel approaches. Using tools from statistical physics and theoretical machine learning, we study the impact of constraints on computation, deriving fundamental bounds for the function of biologically plausible neural networks. We are particularly focused on understanding quantitatively the role of heterogeneity in the dynamics and control of neural systems. In parallel, we build data-driven models for neural population dynamics, using large-scale recordings in behaving animals performing tasks. Our recent focus is on the efficiency of neural computation from both an information theoretic and energetic perspective.
